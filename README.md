**Assignment 2**

**TASK 1**
This Python program first asks the user to enter an integer. It then uses the modulus operator % to check the remainder when the number is divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is identified as even; otherwise, it is odd. Finally, the program displays a message telling the user whether the entered number is even or odd.

**TASK 2**
This Python program initializes a variable sum with 0 and then uses a for loop to go through all numbers from 1 to 50. In each iteration, the current number is added to sum. After the loop finishes, the program displays the total, which represents the sum of all integers from 1 to 50.
