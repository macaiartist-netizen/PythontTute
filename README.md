Input:
The program asks the user to enter two numbers (a and b).
These inputs are converted to integers using int().
Operations:
c = (a + b) â†’ Adds the two numbers.
d = (a - b) â†’ Subtracts the second number from the first.
e = (a * b) â†’ Multiplies the two numbers.
f = (a / b) â†’ Divides the first number by the second.
Output:
Displays the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division one by one using print().

**Task 2**
