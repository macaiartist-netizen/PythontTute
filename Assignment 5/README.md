**TASK 1**
This program acts as a simple database for student marks. It stores names and marks in a dictionary. It then asks the user to enter a student's name. If the name exists in the dictionary, the program prints that student's marks; otherwise, it prints a "student not found" message.

**TASK 2**
This program demonstrates basic list manipulation. It first creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10. It then extracts the first five elements into a new list. Finally, it reverses that new list and prints the original list, the extracted list, and the reversed list.
